# Hello! 

I'm **Kadek Bisma Dharmasena**.

I'm an **Informatics Student** at **Udayana University** with a growing passion for technology and its continuous evolution. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked with various programming languages and tools, including C, Java, JavaFX, Python, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which have helped me tackle diverse projects and challenges.

I recently had the privilege of participating in **Bangkit Academy 2024, Batch 2**, a program powered by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka, where I gained hands-on knowledge in mobile app development using Kotlin and worked with a talented team on an impactful Android capstone project.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I’m looking for opportunities to contribute to the tech community. Let’s connect and build the future together!
